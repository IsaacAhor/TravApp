## Notes

- Subtotal formula: (Flight + Add-ons) Ã— Travelers.
- Flight cost is passed from estimator to summary via lifted state.
- Add-ons total is passed from selector to summary via lifted state.
- Trip plan saved in localStorage on lock, cleared on start over.
- The app is designed to be extended with backend integration in the future.
